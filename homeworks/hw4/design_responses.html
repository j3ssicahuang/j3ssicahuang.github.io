					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned is that there are standards for accessibility standards. An
								example is the United States Access Board (Section 508) which states that websites have 
								to be accessible if it's a federal agency or for a federal agency. There have also been 
								lawsuits in the past which means we should take visible accessibility seriously. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was reading the different tips to make visualizations more
								accessible. For example, in order to add enough contrast, the background-to-text ratio should 
								be at least 4.5:1. I also learned that there are tools in order to measure color combinations which
								I didn't know had existed prior to reading this article.</p>
