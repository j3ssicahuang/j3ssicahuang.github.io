            <p>Hi! My name is Jessica and I love mangoes. Whether it's dried, fresh or simply
                added to a dish, I'm absolutely obsessed. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks
                and admiring the view. One of my favorite scenic spots is Twin Peaks because it's
                convenient to park your car there and watch the city light shimmer. I also enjoy reading
                and I've been trying to slowly build a collection. I'm a hopeless romantic so I enjoy 
                reading books revolving around love. However, I'm also delving into non-fiction books to 
                expand my horizons. I'm always down for hangouts with my friends whether that's a chill night 
                in or going out and getting wild.

                    Something that I learned from this article is that there's a purpose for the way that apps and 
                    websites look. The placement and wording of everything matters and is what keeps the user focused
                    and intrigued.

                    My favorite part of this article is the way the author broke down the layout of multiple apps. From
                    there, they went into detail of certain features that I hadn't even noticed.
