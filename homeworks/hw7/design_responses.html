						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is the Closure principle. It means that
								when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions
								by filling in the gaps to create a unified whole. The Closure principle is important because
								it minimizes visual noise. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was learning about the different principles that are used for
								desgining the user interface. There were descriptions and visualizations to show how that principle
								was at play and what made it work. I think the most interesting one is the Invariance principle because
								it describes how our brain can perceive objects from different perspectives despite different appearances.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. 
								These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some 
								of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape)." </p>
						</li>
