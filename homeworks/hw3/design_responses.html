						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that was brought up in this article was the fact that factors like age and interests
								all play a part in choosing a font. Some fonts are more appropriate for children because they need to
								read with fonts that are clear with the letter shapes. On the other hand, seniors may need fonts that
								are bigger in size and high contrast in colors. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was seeing examples of the many different fonts there are. When choosing a font, it's
								important to pick one that has good readability, legibility and purpose. I believe this brings even more 
								meaning behind the design of a website.</p>
