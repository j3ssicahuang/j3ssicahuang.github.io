					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The term "dark patterns" can be defined as misleading and/or deceptive UI/UX decisions that
							tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they don't really want to do. They're
							designed to take advantage of human psychology and don't have the users' interests in mind. This 
							article describes 11 types of dark patterns which usually work because users often skim the page 
							rather than read in full details.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the mention of "Privacy Zuckering." I figured that it would relate back to Facebook
							and Mark Zuckerberg because of the name. I find it interesting how even though there was a whole scandal 
							about Facebook and its privacy terms, the website is still confusing to users when it comes to deciding 
							how much information should be open to the public to see. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Dark patterns have been around for as long as we can remember; they arenâ€™t limited to the web." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
