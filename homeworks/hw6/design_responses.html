					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is that the optimal speed for interface
								animation is between 200 and 500 ms. This interval is different for different devices as 
								well since the path for objects is different according to size of the screen. Duration
								should be shorter for smaller screens and longer for bigger mobile screens.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part about the article was the fact there were so many examples of good/bad 
								animations. I think being able to visualize the animations helped because you can see the 
								difference between a good one and a bad one. It was also cool seeing how the relationship
								of position and time differed for specific types of animations.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation in the 
								interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, 
								acceleration, etc." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
