                            <p> Something that I learned was the different way messages could be conveyed. Through different 
                                designs, a variety of emotions could be brought out. Furthermore, the color schemes and formatting really
                                do play a big part in interpreting websites and apps.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was seeing the different designs. It was really cool to see the unique features
                                that each one had. Some had a disappearing text feature while others had glass-shattering or wave movements. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the welcome screen by Andrej Radisic because it starts off with a screen that describes
                                what the app is for and there's also an interesting video playing in the background that sparks curiosity. Also,
                                when you swipe up to login or sign up, there's that glass shattering effect with a simple and sleek black background.
                                Another one that I liked was the easygrow.io app by Edmond Vasar. For each vegetable, there's a color theme that blends in well
                                with the object and the fonts are super simple. Furthermore, the features aren't too cluttered around which keeps things
                                simple and easy to navigate.  </p>

                                I thought it was cool to see all the different designs that other people had but I wish there was a theme to it. For example, a section
                                where it's all designs regarding health websites/apps or another section of all designs for shopping.
                            </p>
                        </li>
